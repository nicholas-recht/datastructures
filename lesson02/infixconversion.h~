/***********************************************************************
 * Header File
 *    This is the header file for the InfixConversion Class
 * Summary:
 *    This is the infix conversion class header file. The InfixConversion
 *    class is used to convert an infix equation to a postfix equation.
 *    It is created with a single parameter, a string containing an infix
 *    equation. The result can be obtained with the insertion operator.

 *      The most difficult part was getting the formatting right for
 *      spaces so that the result was readable.
